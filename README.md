# Dark Souls Item Icons
This repo contains a full set of item icons from *DARK SOULS REMASTERED™* for use in video projects, livesplits, etc.

I was kinda annoyed that [the other repo](https://github.com/Kahmul/DarkSoulsIcons) didn't contain all the icons i needed for a [project](https://slendymawn.itch.io/dark-souls-lootbox) i was working on.

So i will spare you, random internet person, from the pain of having to do this yourself in like 4 years time probably.

If something is messed up, open an issue about it and i will get to it when i get to it.
